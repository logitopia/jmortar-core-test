## Build Status

## Justification

You may note that this project only has one Abstract class. You could argue that it doesn’t really deserve it’s own project. The reason for its existence is due to its infant state. I wanted to create a test helper, but it didn’t really belong in core object. That is to say, it was too lazy to simply throw it in that library. Coupled with the fact that I have other ideas down the line for useful testing shortcuts, I decided to put it into this library.

This is the first JMortar library to be migrated to GitHub, once the other libraries are made available, this library’s existence will be made more obvious.
